    My current project and work in progess, built on behalf of a flooring wholesaler.
    The current goal is to provide the client with a site they can login to as administrator and display/manage their products on, with the eventual goal of providing them the functionality to gain access to the retail market and sell directly to end-users.
    The current work on the site is focused around fleshing out administrator functionality to allow all CRUD operations via the back-end.

    Built from the ground up, the goal of these projects was to provide me with a greater knowledge base from which to decide how to proceed with my current project's back-end.
    Projects include a REST Express server-side rendered e-commerce site and a GraphQl blog API with React front-end.
    The most valuable experience I gained from these projects was converting within the projects between multiple approaches, this gave me a solid understanding of the core principles and the varying ways of achieving them.

    technicalPractices: ` The REST API uses EJS to serve HTML, nodemailer for signup & password reset processes, csurf with express-sessions and connect-mongodb-session, stripe for mock payments and pdfkit to generate invoices.
    The app was converted from originally using an SQL database with sequelize to now use mongoDB with mongoose.

    The GraphQL API uses Json-web-token & bcrypt to handle authentication, mongoose with MongoDB to store user data, multer to handle file uploads and validation is handled with express-validator and connect-flash.`,
